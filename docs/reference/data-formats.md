| type | string | Packet type (always "CSI_DATA") |
| seq | int | Sequence number (incrementing) |
| mac | string | MAC address of transmitter |
| rssi | int | Received Signal Strength Indicator (dBm) |
| rate | int | Data rate |
| noise_floor | int | Noise floor measurement |
| fft_gain | int | FFT gain value |
| agc_gain | int | Automatic Gain Control value |
| channel | int | WiFi channel number |
| device_timestamp | int | ESP32 hardware device timestamp counter |
| local_timestamp | string | Local host collection timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm) |

### Example Row

```csv
type,seq,mac,rssi,rate,noise_floor,fft_gain,agc_gain,channel,device_timestamp,local_timestamp,sig_len,rx_state,len,first_word,data,amplitudes,label
CSI_DATA,32633015,1a:00:00:00:00:00,-60,11,-93,12,53,11,2054426858,2025-11-13 17:39:42.845,128,0,384,0,"[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,46,...]","[0.0, 0.0, 48.38, ...]",0
```

### Notes

- `amplitudes` array always has 64 values (one per subcarrier)
- `label` column added during collection with keyboard input
- `predicted_label` column only present if live inference is enabled

## Feature CSV

### Schema

CSV file produced by the processing module.

| Column | Type | Description |
| -------- | ------ | ------------- |
| window_id | int | Window index (0-based) |
| start_seq | int | Sequence number of first sample in window |
| end_seq | int | Sequence number of last sample in window |
| label | int | Class label (only in labeled mode) |
| [features] | float | One column per extracted feature |

### Example (Standard Mode)

```csv
window_id,start_seq,end_seq,mean_amp,std_amp,max_amp,min_amp,mean_last3,std_last3,mean_last10
9,900,999,45.2,3.1,52.3,38.1,45.0,1.9,44.8
10,1000,1099,46.1,2.9,51.8,39.0,45.5,0.7,45.1
```

### Example (Labeled Mode)

```csv
window_id,start_seq,end_seq,label,mean_amp,std_amp,max_amp,min_amp,mean_last3,std_last3,mean_last10
9,900,999,1,45.2,3.1,52.3,38.1,45.0,1.9,44.8
10,1000,1099,1,46.1,2.9,51.8,39.0,45.5,0.7,45.1
```

### Notes

- Feature columns are dynamic based on selected features
- `label` column required for training
- Edge windows may be skipped if features need context

## Prediction CSV

### Schema

CSV file produced by inference module.

| Column | Type | Description |
| -------- | ------ | ------------- |
| window_id | int | Window index |
| start_seq | int | First sample sequence number |

| predicted_label | string/int | Predicted class label |
| prob_class_[X] | float | Probability for class X (if --probabilities flag used) |

### Example (Without Probabilities)

```csv
window_id,start_seq,end_seq,predicted_label
0,0,99,1
1,100,199,1
2,200,299,2
```

### Example (With Probabilities)

```csv
window_id,start_seq,end_seq,predicted_label,prob_class_1,prob_class_2,prob_class_3
0,0,99,1,0.92,0.05,0.03
